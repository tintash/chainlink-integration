Create a `.env` file in the root `chainlink-integration` folder with the following contents:

```
EI_LINK_JOB_PATH    = /v2/specs/
EI_CHAINLINKURL     = <URL of your chainlink node>
EI_IC_ACCESSKEY     = <INSERT KEY>
EI_IC_SECRET        = <INSERT KEY>
EI_CI_ACCESSKEY     = <INSERT KEY>
EI_CI_SECRET        = <INSERT KEY>
```

In order to use external initiators in your Chainlink node, enable the following config in your Chainlink node's environment:

```
FEATURE_EXTERNAL_INITIATORS=true
```

`EI_IC_ACCESSKEY`, `EI_IC_SECRET`, `EI_CI_ACCESSKEY` and `EI_CI_SECRET` are generated by Chainlink node when you run following command:

```
chainlink initiators create {NAME} {URL}
```
in Chainlink CLI. `{NAME}` here is your external initiator's name whereas `{URL}` is the url of external initiator server (this server).


This repository also contains a clarinet project at `contracts/clarity` and following command can be used to deploy `oracle` and `direct-request` contracts on mocknet:
```
clarinet deploy --mocknet
```
